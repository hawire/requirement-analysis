# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on **Requirement Analysis**, a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  
It provides an overview of its purpose, key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of **understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders** for a software project.  
It ensures that developers build a system that meets user requirements and business objectives.  

**Importance in SDLC:**
- Bridges the gap between stakeholder expectations and technical implementation.
- Prevents misunderstandings or missing requirements.
- Serves as the foundation for system design and development.

---

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Defines Project Scope:** Clarifies what features and functions will be included in the system.  
2. **Reduces Cost and Rework:** Early identification of errors or missing requirements saves development time and resources.  
3. **Enhances Stakeholder Communication:** Aligns all parties on expectations and deliverables, reducing conflicts later.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting stakeholder needs via interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refining and exploring requirements using brainstorming, prototyping, or scenarios.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating detailed documents such as requirement specifications, use cases, and functional descriptions.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Structuring, prioritizing, and modeling requirements using diagrams or prototypes.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure completeness, consistency, and feasibility.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Describe **what the system should do**.  

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- User Registration and Login  
- Property Search and Filters  
- Booking Checkout  
- Payment Processing  

### Non-functional Requirements
Describe **how the system should perform** (quality attributes).  

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- Page load time under 2 seconds  
- Secure and encrypted payment processing  
- Scalability to handle thousands of bookings per day  
- 24/7 availability and uptime

## Use Case Diagrams

**Definition:**  
Use Case Diagrams visualize the **interactions between users (actors) and the system**, helping stakeholders understand system functionality.  

**Benefits:**  
- Provides a clear, visual representation of system behavior.  
- Helps identify all possible user interactions and scenarios.  
- Supports requirement validation and documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Definition:**  
Acceptance Criteria are **conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders**.  

**Importance:**  
- Provides a clear checklist for developers and testers.  
- Ensures features meet stakeholder expectations.  
- Reduces miscommunication and rework.  

**Example – Checkout Feature:**  
- User must be able to select a property and add it to the cart.  
- Payment should be processed securely.  
- Confirmation receipt is sent to the user upon successful booking.  
- Booking should appear in the user's account history.
